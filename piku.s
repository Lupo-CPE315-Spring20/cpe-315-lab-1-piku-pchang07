main:
    @ Stack the return address (lr) in addition to a dummy register (ip) to
    @ keep the stack 8-byte aligned.
    push    {ip, lr}

    @ Load the argument and perform the call. This is like 'printf("...")' in C.
    ldr     r0, = line1
    bl      printf
    ldr	    r0, = line2
    bl	    printf
    ldr	    r0, = line3
    bl	    printf

    @ Exit from 'main'. This is like 'return 0' in C.
    mov     r0, #0      @ Return 0.
    @ Pop the dummy ip to reverse our alignment fix, and pop the original lr
    @ value directly into pc — the Program Counter — to return.
    pop     {ip, pc}

    @ --------------------------------
    @ Data for the printf call. The GNU assembler's ".asciz" directive
    @ automatically adds a NULL character termination.
line1:
    .asciz "Raspberry sweet pi\n"
line2:
    .asciz "Equals three point one four one\n"
line3:
    .asciz "Let's code this quarter\n"
